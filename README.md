# Telecom Customer Churn Prediction

## Project Overview
This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict customer churn in the telecom industry. Using the Telco Customer Churn dataset from Kaggle, the project involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and deploying a predictive web application using Flask.

## Dataset Description
The dataset includes 7,043 records with 21 attributes, such as:
- **Gender**: Male/Female
- **SeniorCitizen**: Binary (0/1)
- **Tenure**: Number of months a customer has stayed
- **Contract**: Month-to-month, one year, two years
- **Churn**: Yes/No (Target Variable)

This dataset provides comprehensive details to help build predictive models for customer churn.
